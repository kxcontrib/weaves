Building qoxygen.

I've now added a requirement on gnulib-tool. With it, qoxygen can build on Cygwin and Solaris.

See the installation notes in the directory above.

There is also a facility to build qoxygen for Windows. This uses the qoxygen sub-directory.
This has a Visual Studio 2005 Solution and projects within it. These use the qoxygen.c
file generated by Flex++.

-- From the original notes for mtoc

This is a documentation system based on Doxygen. 

You are assumed to have the following installed:

- doxygen. I use version 1.5.1. On the Mac I installed the dmg image based 
  distribution of Doyxgen and manually linked /usr/local/bin/doxygen to the 
  underlying executable that was installed. This avoids a fink or macports 
  extravaganza.

- a recent TeX installation. teTeX works well for me on Mac OSX and Linux. 
 
- lex. I use flex 2.5.35.

- a c and c++ compiler. gcc and g++ version 3 work fine.

Basics:

1. Type make in this directory. 

2. Install qoxygen to somewhere on your PATH.

3. Change to the simple_example directory and type make. 

4. simple_example/source_reference.pdf and example/source_reference/index.html
   are the pdf and html formatted output from the example.q file. See that
   q file for examples of commenting functions.

5. Same goes for benchmark_example.

6. You can copy the contents of the example directory to create your own
   projects. You should edit your copy of example/Makefile in the new project
   to point TOP_DIR to the directory containing the qoxygen executable and
   style directory. Adjust the path, also, to the included Makefile from the
   style directory. For example:

   TOP_DIR=../../tools/qoxygen
   include ../../tools/qoxygen/style/Makefile

7. "It works for me."

8. Feel free to contribue a nicer html style.
