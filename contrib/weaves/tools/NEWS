** March 2010

I've improved the support for contexts. They are now treated as namespaces.

\d .t

f: { [x;y] x+y }

\d .

Becomes 

 namespace _t {

   f(x,y) {}
 
 }

Functions like 

 .u.f

 become namespace u { f() {} }

It will document 

\d .t

i.args

\d .

as _t::i::args

** Limited support for contexts

I've extended this to support definitions within contexts. This

.sys.this: { [x] x }

will produce sys_this() as a definition within doxygen.

It doesn't support contexts directly, so

\d .ctx

.this: { [x] x }

\d .

will appear as this().

** Source documentation - line numbers

The most useful extension I've made is to align the line numbering so that
the doxygen will give you a link to the source. This means you can use
doxygen to document and navigate your source files.

* mtoc and rtoc

These do still work, but I haven't done any development with them lately.

* rtoq

There is also r2q from Niall Ferguson. I haven't used this yet. If it works
let me know. If there are any improvement you can propose, then pass them
on.

* Emacs Modes - kdbp and q-minor

These have been working for me for some time. The kdbp mode will colour the
source code files. The q-minor mode give you the means to execute lines and
buffers. It can't do a block of code at the moment. There is a means of
using master scripts. I don't really make use of it.
