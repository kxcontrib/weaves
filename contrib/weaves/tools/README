There are a number of packages provided here.

qoxygen - was originally developed by Niall Ferguson. It provides a filter to work with
Doxygen. 

mtoc - was originally developed by Ian Martins and provides a means of putting MatLab
scripts under Doxygen.

rtoc - is my development of mtoc and puts R scripts under Doxygen.

emacs - I've extended the kdbp-mode.el and the q-minor-mode.el to provide an interactive
development environment. It works with the qsys extensions I've developed. This is not
currently installed by configure.
