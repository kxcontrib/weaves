+ Stability

The regex and smet functions aren't very fault-tolerarnt. They may
unexpectedly close your q interpreter session. Usually, this is a
data-typing issue - typically passing a symbol and not a string.

The example (in the directory examples) shows how to use a string
metric (and regular expressions) reliably.

+ Stripping punctuation

The function depunct[] only removes a subset of punctuation
characters.
