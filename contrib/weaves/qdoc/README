qdoc is best added as an AC_CONFIG_SUBDIR

if test -d "$srcdir/qdoc"; then
 AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([qdoc])
fi

It looks for qoxygen.

It generates a doxygen configuration file from that in cfg/dev.doxy.in
This uses the autoconf definitions for htmldir and others.
It runs the resulting script through a filter to expand the variables.

A typical configure invocation might be:

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME 

The doxygen installs into ${prefix}/share/doc usually. You can change this

 either - by editting the dev.doxy.in
 or - using the prefix command to configure

But you will need to add a real cfg/dev.doxy.in. There is a sample - for the 
qsys system at code.kx.com

This dev.doxy.in.sample is only a guideline for q/kdb and is biased to produce HTML
and manual pages. You only need to change the INPUT and EXCLUDE and it should be ready to go.
If you update the configuration you should change your dev.doxy.in and then

 config.status

to regenerate the file dev.doxy
