qdoc is best added as an AC_CONFIG_SUBDIR

if test -d "$srcdir/qdoc"; then
 AC_CONFIG_SUBDIRS([qdoc])
fi

It looks for qoxygen.

It generates a doxygen configuration file from that in cfg/dev.doxy.in
This uses the autoconf definitions for htmldir and others.
It runs the resulting script through a filter to expand the variables.

A typical configure invocation might be:

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME --htmldir=$HOME/public_html/qdoc

This dev.doxy.in is only a guideline for q/kdb and is biased to produce HTML
and manual pages. To change the configuration change dev.doxy.in and then

 config.status

to regenerate the file dev.doxy.in
