Installation is very much as one would expect.

Simply use ./configure, but usually one only wants to install in one's
own home directory and into the q executable directory

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-qhomedir=$HOME/q

(There are other switches to change the name of the --with-qprogdir and the
name of the q executable --with-qprog.)

The installation has been tested with Linux, Darwin and Solaris. It assumes
that the q program directory will be $qhomedir/[lms][32|64]

That is ~/q/l32 for Linux 32-bit

If this doesn't work, you can try to override by setting 

 --with-progdir=~/q/x64

for example.

The qsys environment comes with a C plugin for the q interpreter "smet".

This is built by default. It can be removed from the build using 

 --disable-string-metrics

This is a sub-build of the main qsys build.

--

For Solaris, I've only tested on 32-bit sparc. I used the gcc 3.4.2
compiler.

--

If you want to extend the package you'll need at least automake 1.9

It's best to delete the contents of the config/ and smet/config/ 
directories and then

 autoreconf --force --install

and then configure as normal.

--

The build system uses gnulib, so a GCC compiler is required.

It builds in the src directory. It just applies sed
transformations to scripts marked with .in suffix.

 make install

will do the following

 In the $qhomedir given on the command-line to configure, the q.q file
 will be deleted and replaced by a link to site.q

 A number of q script files are installed in ~/share/qsys

 The scripts Qp Qr and Qs are installed in ~/bin

 The configuration files use-q and q.rc are installed in ~/etc

 Other documentation files are installed. (These currently have
 nothing of use in them.)

The "string metrics" sub-package will also install into

 ~/share/qsys 
 ~/lib/qsys

--

There is no feature to uninstall.

--

The installation works on both MacOSX and Linux - both 32bit.
