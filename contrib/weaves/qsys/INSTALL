Installation is a bit more complicated than usual because I've made use of
gnulib and gnulib-tool.

Also, this installation uses an SVN repository and some externals to keep the source up-to-date.
The SVN repository is read-only, so you need to copy a Makefile.am. This is done in the autogen.sh
script as well.

The installation needs to run gnulib-tool on the smet directory. There is a
script autogen.sh that shows the steps.

Simply use ./configure, but usually one only wants to install in one's
own home directory and into the q executable directory

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-qhomedir=$HOME/q

(There are other switches to change the name of the --with-qprogdir and the
name of the q executable --with-qprog.)

The installation has been tested with Linux, Darwin and Solaris. It assumes
that the q program directory will be $qhomedir/[lms][32|64]

That is ~/q/l32 for Linux 32-bit

If this doesn't work, you can try to override by setting 

 --with-progdir=~/q/x64

for example.

String Metrics - the smet directory

The qsys environment comes with a C plugin for the q interpreter "smet".
The build is in in a sub-directory of this and is built by default. 
It uses an auxilary autoreconf phase. This may fail. The smet build needs
to have gnulib-tool run on it first, see the INSTALL file in the smet directory. 
After you've done that then a complete autoreconf should work.

The can be removed from the build using 

 --disable-string-metrics

This is a sub-build of the main qsys build.

--

If you want to extend the package you'll need at least automake 1.9

It's best to delete the contents of the config/ and smet/config/ 
directories and then

 autoreconf --force --install

and then configure as normal.

--

It builds in the src directory. It just applies sed
transformations to scripts marked with .in suffix.

 make install

will do the following

 In the $qhomedir given on the command-line to configure, the q.q file
 will be deleted and replaced by a link to site.q

 A number of q script files are installed in ~/share/qsys

 The scripts Qp Qr and Qs are installed in ~/bin

 The configuration files use-q and q.rc are installed in ~/etc

 Other documentation files are installed. (These currently have
 nothing of use in them.)

The "string metrics" sub-package will also install into

 ~/share/qsys 
 ~/lib/qsys

--

There is no feature to uninstall.

The installation works on both Linux and Solaris - both 32bit.
