*New Service: factory

qsys now supports a factory server for splayed tables.

If you need a splayed table server and you want to set the .Q.view,
you can use a factory to create a server just for you.

*New Functions: add a load path to the command-line

Servers can now be given an additional set of paths to load from on
the command-line.

*New Functions: automated port choice

A server can now get a free port and publish it to the trader.

*New Service: trader

qsys now has a trader service. This means you can find splay table
servers in a lookup server.

*Working with qsys

Installing the Qp Qr and Qs scripts won't make them available. They
are installed into ~/bin. You will need to put this on your PATH.

The q.rc file in ~/etc allows you to change installation easily.

You can override that with one in ~/.q.rc

The scripts use the file ~/etc/use-q to provide a function tailored to a
particular host or runtime environment. The implemenation given is
only a sample. The use of the QHOME, QPATH and QLOAD is to demonstrate
how they can be used.
