Working with qsys

Installing the Qp Qr and Qs scripts won't make them available. They
are installed into ~/bin. You will need to put this on your PATH.

The q.rc file in ~/etc allows you to change installation easily.

You can override that with one in ~/.q.rc

The scripts use the file ~/etc/use-q to provide a function tailored to a
particular host or runtime environment. The implemenation given is
only a sample. The use of the QHOME, QPATH and QLOAD is to demonstrate
how they can be used.
