This library is still in prototype.

Not needed: use this two, where secs1day is 86000

// datetime to fractional seconds
//
// Add the offset from kdb datetime epoch start and the UTC epoch start.
// Add the datetime on and multiply up by the day count.
// Doesn't work. Adds 25 seconds.
// @note
// Don't use real only float seems to work. float is double.
// @TODO
// This counts the leap seconds because the arithmetic is done by the 
// the subtraction of the types.
atime1: { [dt] x0:`float$dt; (`float$.f.consts[`secs1day]) * (x0 + 10957.0f) }

atime2: { [f0] f1: (`float$f0) % `float$.f.consts[`secs1day]; f1-: 10957.0f; `datetime$f1 }

It provides access for q/kdb+ to UTC functions in the C libraries.

In particular, it can convert a datetime to a UTC. That is, seconds since 1970.01.01T00:00:00.000.
