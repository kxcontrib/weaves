I had a struggle getting to work on GNU/Linux systems and Solaris.

Solaris 8 has a POSIX compliant library. This has a larger regmatch_t structure
that contains pointers.

GNU/Linux complies with only the offset part of the structure. I have only used
the offsets.

Solaris 8 has the peculiar semantics that it will only return a substring
location if the regular expression has sub-expressions.

So all regular expressions have to be wrapped in a pair of brackets:
(a) will match abc. The brackets are added by the function enquote(),
which uses sprintf() and a static buffer. enquote() doesn't affect
the operation of the GNU library, so I've left it enabled for GNU.

Also the POSIX REG_ICASE doesn't seem to work on Solaris 8. So the pattern 
and the string are forced to lower-case by strtolower(). The REG_ICASE flag is
passed to re1_cc and re1_match. Again, I've left this enabled for the
GNU system too.

The POSIX implementation will only return sub-expressions if the nsub
is set to at least 2. So that means that regmatch_t has be at least
two in length.

The GNU implementation doesn't need the brackets, observes REG_ICASE
and will return a sub-string location with a regmatch_t of length 1.

The gnulib-tool --import regex doesn't work (for me) with the POSIX code. 
It assumes GNU_SOURCE and that regmatch_t is only 8 bytes and not the
POSIX 24.

So a switch is added to configure.in to check for the larger
structure. This switches which header file is used in egex0.h. This
may not work on your POSIX system (it uses /usr/include/regex.h).
