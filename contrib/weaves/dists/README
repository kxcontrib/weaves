DoxyGen filters for .q files

http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/config.html#cfg_filter_patterns

doxygenf.zip contains Cygwin and Windows XP SP3 builds of the qoxygen.exe 
utility.

- Windows

These have been built with VisualStudio 2005 on Windows XP SP3. 
doxygenf.msi and doxygenf.exe are the install and setup executable.
There is a requirement that the VC8 redistributable package be installed.

The executables install into c:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data

On Windows, DoxyGen will use the executable, but DoxyGen does not like spaces in the path.
So use quotes in the FILTER_PATTERNS specification. 

- Cygwin on Windows

The executable in i686-pc-cygwin require the cyggcc_s-1 and cygwin1 DLLs.

This is a late Cygwin build (post 1.7). The source at
 code.kx.com
does support a Cygwin build: it needs gcc3 or better, flex, autoconf and automake.
